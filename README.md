I have a lot that I want to add/change about the app. I want to connected to the RAWG game database, have a search and filter function, have user authentication, allow users to connect to their game apps so it shows when they're online, trailer video embeds, follow and add friend features, wishlists and lists features, and much more. I have high hopes for the app and I want to work on it indefinitely
